“The live phase is about supporting the service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements.” – [How the live phase works](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-live-phase-works), GDS Service Manual

## During live you will work with:

- a smaller delivery team
- the BAU content team to make sure GOV.UK guidance content and the service are joined up

## When a service is in live, you may be designing content to:

- optimise the user journey and increase completion rate
- design solutions for known user needs that were not met in beta
- iterate the service based on new user needs
- add new features that were not part of the minimum viable product (MVP)
- keep things factually up to date
- fix bugs (like missing Welsh or alt text)
- continue to improve accessibility

## Your service will be iterated frequently based on insight from sources like:

- Google Analytics
- back-office or customer data
- online surveys
- call centre feedback or support tickets
- A/B testing
- usability testing of new features
