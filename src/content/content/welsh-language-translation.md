Public organisations and citizen-facing services operating in Wales must provide the same service in Welsh as they do in English.

[Welsh language standards](https://www.welshlanguagecommissioner.wales/public-organisations/welsh-language-schemes) are set by the [Welsh Language Commissioner](https://www.welshlanguagecommissioner.wales/about-us) and ensure that the Welsh language is not treated less favourably than the English language in Wales.

Under the Welsh Language Act 1993, several public organisations are required to prepare a Welsh language scheme. For examples see the [APHA Welsh language scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/welsh-language-scheme) and the [Rural Payments Agency Welsh language scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/welsh-language-scheme-rural-payments-agency/welsh-language-scheme-revised-2020-in-english).

Defra does not appear to have a Welsh language scheme in place, but this doesn’t mean Welsh translation is not needed!

## What needs translating?

You will need to arrange translations for all content in an online service such as:

- buttons
- cookies
- hint text
- error messages
- privacy policies
- maintenance pages
- accessibility statements
- hidden text used by screen readers

Letters, emails and texts sent to users in Wales also need translating. There is [guidance from GDS about the translation of GOV.UK pages](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-the-government-digital-service/request-a-thing#welsh-language-translation). You should also consider arrangements for users who need support over the phone.

## How to get a Welsh translation

### Through the FCDO

Defra buys translation services from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) under a Memorandum of Understanding that covers Core Defra and its ALBs (though only APHA and VMD are mentioned) – see [Translations on Defra Intranet](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/Defraintranet/SitePages/Translations.aspx). Translations take 2 to 3 working days.

Email [translationrequests@fcdo.gov.uk](mailto:translationrequests@fcdo.gov.uk) for a quote for the translation. It can take a couple of weeks between getting a quote for the translation (from FCDO) to getting a purchase order for it (from your finance team). Your delivery manager can help you with the finance part of this.

Here’s an example of how the ‘Taking a pet from Great Britain to Northern Ireland’ team did this:

1.  Estimated the number of words needing translation 2 to 4 weeks in advance.
2.  Asked [translationrequests@fcdo.gov.uk](mailto:translationrequests@fcdo.gov.uk) for a quote. Guess on the generous side to allow for leeway. Charges may vary, but as a guide 1,000 words will cost £160 + VAT and there is a minimum charge of £75 (as of August 2024).
3.  Send the quote to your Finance contact to raise a purchase order.
4.  Around 2 to 4 weeks later, send the purchase order and the content you’ve gathered for translation to FCDO. At the same time, start the process off again asking for a purchase order ready for the next batch of Welsh translation.

### Through Natural Resources Wales

Natural Resources Wales provides Welsh translation for certain Environment Agency services with funding arrangements in place - for example, the fishing licence service. They’re open to small, ad hoc changes during the process.

The request process is different from FCDO. Content is provided by email (for small changes) or updated in a table directly by the translator on Confluence (for longer or complex changes). In all instances screenshots are provided to show the content in the context shown to the user.

## Sharing content with developers

Share Welsh content with developers in a way that suits the type or amount of content being provided. Find what works best for your team. You may want to consider:

- adding the Welsh and English to a table directly on the Jira ticket
- creating a table in a Word document – there is more flexibility to show personalised or conditional content here than on Jira
- providing it in a prototype
- adding the translations to a spreadsheet
- creating a page on Confluence

You may like to create a Microsoft Planner to track translations in progress. When saving and storing translations, find what works best for your team.
