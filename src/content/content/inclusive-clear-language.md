## Making technical content easier for users

You should write in plain English to make things easier for your users. When you need to use technical or legal terms, you can. But explain them the first time you use them.

For example: You can only burn authorised fuel, unless you use a Defra approved appliance – this is known as an ‘exempt appliance’.

You should use the language that your users understand and use. For example, in guidance about combustion plants, use 'combustion', not 'burning'.

But you should put technical words in short, active sentences that make it easier for people to read.

See [GDS writing well for specialists advice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#writing-well-for-specialists).

## Experts prefer clear language

Even technical experts prefer content in plain English. Research into the use of specialist legal language has shown that when given a choice, 80% of people prefer sentences written in plain English. The more literate and expert a person is, the greater their preference for plain English because it saves them reading time.

Users are more likely to believe your content if it explains complex material in a way that’s easy to understand – and this includes experts.
