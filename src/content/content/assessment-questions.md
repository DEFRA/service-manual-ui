The delivery team will be asked questions during a service assessment.

These are examples of questions you might be asked as a user-centred design team, alongside user research, service design and interaction design. This is not an exhaustive list.

- What constraints are you working within? What are the barriers to removing or reducing the impact of those constraints?
- How do you know a service is the right way to solve the problem you’re looking at?
- How do you know you’ve got the scope of the service right?
- How did you define the MVP?
- Talk us through a few of the design iterations you tested - and explain why you rejected them
- How will users find the service initially?
- Why do users need the thing you’re planning to build or buy?
- What do you know about the offline parts of your user’s journey?
- How will you know your service joins up with those offline elements?
- Who are you inviting to your user research sessions?
- What are you doing to make sure users don’t have to provide the same information multiple times and reusing data from across government?
- How are you planning to make sure that the service doesn't exclude any existing or potential users of your service?
- How are you improving users’ experience across different channels?
- How are you implementing recommendations from the Accessibility audit on your service?
- What is your approach to access needs and assisted digital needs?
- What support will you offer to users who have problems with the digital part of the service?
