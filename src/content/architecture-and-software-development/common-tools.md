Defra provides a set of common tools and platforms to help teams meet [Service Standard point 11: Choose the right tools and technology](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-11-choose-the-right-tools-and-technology). Using common tools means you can focus on solving user problems and will:

- improve user journeys
- comply with national standards for security and accessibility
- reduce the cost and time of building services
