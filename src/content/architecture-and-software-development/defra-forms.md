## When to use Defra Forms

Defra Forms has tools to help you:

- collect information from users through simple online forms
- change forms to meet your needs, or quickly add new forms to your service

## How it works

Defra Forms gives you 2 ways to create forms:

### Form builder

Use the form builder to create and publish forms. Forms are automatically styled to meet GOV.UK design standards and accessibility requirements.

### Plugin

Use the plugin if you need to create custom forms in your service. You can extend or integrate it without writing much code.

## Benefits

Using Defra Forms means you:

- do not need to build your own form components
- get accessible forms that meet GOV.UK standards
- do not need to build your own form builder
