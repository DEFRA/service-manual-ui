## How it works

The Core Delivery Platform is Defra's internal development platform. It provides standardised tools, pipelines and processes so you can build and manage services without depending on separate infrastructure or teams.

## Getting started

You will need to read the following documentation if your service adopts the Core Delivery Platform:

- [onboarding considerations](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/onboarding/onboarding-considerations.md) to understand what the platform offers
- [architectural overview](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/architecture/architectural-overview.md) to learn how the platform is built
- [how-to documentation](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/how-to/how-to.md)

To access the [Core Delivery Platform](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/), you will need to be on a Defra device or VPN.
