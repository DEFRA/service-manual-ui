Create a clear, prioritised roadmap showing how you'll evolve to deliver better outcomes.

## Why this matters

A clear roadmap helps delivery groups make better decisions and avoid conflicting priorities. Teams understand how their work contributes to larger goals. Stakeholders gain confidence and teams stay motivated.

Without a roadmap, organisations react to immediate pressures rather than working towards strategic goals. This leads to confusion, wasted resources and eroded trust.

## How we measure success

We use a red, amber, green (RAG) rating.

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--green">Green</strong> Clear roadmap with priorities and regular reviews

You have a published roadmap that links change initiatives to outcomes and services. Prioritisation is transparent and evidence-based.

You must be able to show:

- a published roadmap linking change initiatives to outcomes and services
- transparent, evidence-based prioritisation processes
- regular roadmap reviews
- team-wide understanding of the roadmap and individual roles

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--yellow">Amber</strong> Incomplete roadmap with unclear priorities

A roadmap exists but lacks detail, clear priorities, or regular updates. Stakeholders may not understand priorities or how decisions are made.

Common problems can include:

- roadmap lacks detail or specificity
- priorities based on opinion rather than evidence
- frequent unexplained changes
- poor stakeholder alignment or understanding

To move to green, you should:

- add specificity to roadmap items
- establish clear prioritisation procedures
- create regular review cycles
- improve communication with teams and stakeholders

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Red</strong> No roadmap

No clear roadmap exists. The organisation operates reactively without a shared view of future direction.

Common problems can include:

- no documented roadmap or future plans
- conflicting initiatives across teams
- duplicate efforts and wasted resources
- unclear connection to strategic goals
- misaligned stakeholder expectations
