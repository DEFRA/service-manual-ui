Define and share clear measures of success so everyone can see whether outcomes are being achieved.

## Why this matters

Success measures help delivery groups understand if their work achieves intended outcomes. Clear, shared metrics enable better decisions, accountability, and cross-team learning. Transparent progress tracking lets teams identify what works and adapt quickly.

Without these measures, groups risk prioritising activity over impact, wasting effort, missing learning opportunities, and remaining uncertain about outcome achievement.

## How we measure success

We use a red, amber, green (RAG) rating.

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--green">Green</strong> Clear measures with transparent reporting

Measurable indicators of success are defined and shared for each outcome. Progress is tracked and reported regularly.

You must be able to show:

- measurable indicators of success defined and shared for each outcome
- measures link to delivery group outcomes, not just activity
- performance data receives regular analysis and discussion
- progress updates and insights are published and accessible to stakeholders
- data informs decisions and roadmap prioritisation

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--yellow">Amber</strong> Partial measures or inconsistent reporting

Some measures exist but focus on outputs rather than outcomes. Reporting is irregular or not widely shared.

Common problems can include:

- measures emphasise outputs rather than outcomes
- data collection happens irregularly or lacks effective analysis
- progress reporting is infrequent or siloed within teams
- limited data use for decision-making
- stakeholders have differing success understandings

To move to green, you should:

- define focused measures clearly linked to outcomes
- establish regular data collection and analysis
- create consistent reporting schedules
- use performance data for roadmap decisions
- align stakeholder understanding of success

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Red</strong> No defined measures or progress tracking

No shared success measures exist. Progress assessment is subjective or anecdotal.

Common problems can include:

- no success measures or performance indicators exist
- progress updates are infrequent or absent
- decisions lack evidence or data backing
- success judged by outputs or effort, not outcomes
- teams and stakeholders lack shared progress understanding
