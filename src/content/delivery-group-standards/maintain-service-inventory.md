Maintain a clear, up-to-date list of all your services and who owns them.

## Why this matters

Successful delivery groups maintain visibility of everything they manage. This prevents neglect and duplication, supports better decisions, and directs resources effectively.

Without a defined service map or inventory, organisations struggle to identify problems early, reuse assets, or make informed resource allocation choices.

## How we measure success

We use a red, amber, green (RAG) rating.

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--green">Green</strong> Clear, complete and current

The group maintains an up-to-date service and product map with explicit ownership, performance measures, and user journeys. Service relationships and connections to outcomes are clear.

You must be able to show:

- a service map or inventory showing all services
- identified ownership for each service
- service relationships are understood
- services connect to outcomes

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--yellow">Amber</strong> Partial or inconsistent view

Some services are documented, but records are incomplete or ownership is unclear. Service-to-outcome connections are partially articulated.

Common problems can include:

- service map exists but is incomplete or outdated
- ownership unclear or disputed
- service relationships poorly understood
- services lack outcome linkages

To move to green, you should:

- complete and update the service inventory
- assign clear service owners
- document service dependencies
- link services explicitly to outcomes

### <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Red</strong> No defined or coherent view of services

No coherent service or product view exists. Operations are fragmented across projects with unclear ownership and accountability.

Common problems can include:

- no inventory or map exists
- teams hold conflicting views of services
- ownership and accountability lack clarity
- services operate disconnected from outcomes
- work organised as projects rather than services
