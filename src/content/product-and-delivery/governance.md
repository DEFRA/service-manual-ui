Learn about [delivery group governance](https://defra.github.io/delivery-group-governance/). This includes essential information about:

- [Spend Control](https://defra.github.io/delivery-group-governance/assurance/spend-control/) - how to get approval for spending
- [Service Assessments](https://defra.github.io/delivery-group-governance/assurance/service-assessments/) - checking you meet the standard
- [Operational Service Readiness](https://defra.github.io/delivery-group-governance/assurance/operational-service-readiness/) - preparing to go live

Visit the [DDTS Portfolio Hub](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/def-ddts-portfoliohub/SitePages/Agile---Beta.aspx) to learn in detail about requirements for governance and assurance when delivering digital and technology projects at Defra.

Here you will find a wealth of information including tasks and templates for delivery in the Discovery, Alpha, and Beta phases.

## Project phases

Identify the phase that your service has currently reached.

If the service has progressed beyond discovery, you can find [Service Assessment reports from earlier phases on SharePoint](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/ea-leg-project-assurance/Readonly_GDS/Forms/AllItems.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=4ZLZfi&ovuser=770a2450%2D0227%2D4c62%2D90c7%2D4e38537f1102%2CRhys%2EWilliams%40defra%2Egov%2Euk&OR=Teams%2DHL&CT=1753089916509&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI0OS8yNTA3MDMxODgwNiIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D&CID=a1e7b3a1%2D3036%2Dd000%2D6e9e%2D7c40c70a1c3a&cidOR=SPO&FolderCTID=0x01200052197A618B54624DB9E4031279E34EC6&id=%2Fsites%2Fea%2Dleg%2Dproject%2Dassurance%2FReadonly%5FGDS%2FGDS%20Assessments).
