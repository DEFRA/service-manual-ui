## Tools

If your team intends to use Atlassian Jira and Confluence for work item management and documentation, read the guide on [how to get a Jira and Confluence license (SharePoint)](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/Team4195/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B342694D4-BCD9-4846-9B73-5BCE175E3BE5%7D&file=How%20to%20get%20a%20JIRA%20%20Confluence%20licence.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true).

## Security clearance

If you hold a current security clearance and you wish to transfer it to Defra, contact the [Defra Security Vetting team](mailto:SecurityVetting@defra.gov.uk) to request the transfer form.

## Accessibility standards

Ensure you understand [Defra’s accessibility standards](/accessibility) when building or buying software.

Accessibility is not an optional Defra request; it is the law.
