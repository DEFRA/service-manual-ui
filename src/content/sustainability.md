Defra adheres to the cross-government [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). All services must meet the standard's 14 points.

Because of Defra's role in protecting the environment, services must also meet this 15th point about sustainability.

## Why it's important

Defra's services aim to bring tangible environmental benefits to our society – from improving water quality to boosting the nation's resilience to flooding. Benefits can also come from replacing existing processes that are relatively resource intensive with more lightweight and modern equivalents.

However, the use of technology for government services also contributes to climate change and other sustainability risks.

- **Energy use** contributes to warming greenhouse gases.
- **Hardware manufacturing** (mining and processing) can lead to water scarcity, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss.
- **Supply chains** can have unintended social impacts, such as labour exploitation.

The Greening Government Commitments and [Defra's Digital Sustainability Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defra-digital-sustainability-strategy-2025-to-2030) set objectives to reduce the impacts of the use of digital technology.

## What it means

Service teams should design, develop, and operate their services to be as sustainable as possible, and set out their approach in a **sustainability statement**.

The statement should lay out what actions have been taken, and those that are planned, against the [6 objectives](/sustainability/objectives) of [Defra's Digital Sustainability Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defra-digital-sustainability-strategy-2025-to-2030).

### Detailed guidance
