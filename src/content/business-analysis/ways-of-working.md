## Tools and standards

Defra BAs use BPMN 2.0 for process mapping. Create diagrams in MS Visio or Mural, depending on delivery requirements. Check with your Principal BA.

Capture user stories and acceptance criteria in Jira (including Confluence) or Azure DevOps. They must adhere to INVEST.

If these tools are not available, download the **[User story template (Excel spreadsheet)](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/Team924/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2496D0D7-6AC3-4F5A-A8B0-47CF2925EC95%7D&file=User%20Story%20Template%20-%20V1.2%20including%20user%20needs.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)**.

## Manage your artifacts

You must:

- create artifacts in tools Defra can access
- save artifacts to the delivery document library and the BA repository

When you finish work, add it to the [BA repository](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/DDTSBusinessAnalysis/SitePages/BA-Repository.aspx).
