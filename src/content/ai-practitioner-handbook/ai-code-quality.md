AI can produce code that looks polished on the surface but is difficult to maintain, extend, or fix.

## What happened

A team used AI to generate a significant portion of a codebase. The code passed senior code reviews and appeared to work correctly. However, when the team later needed to fix bugs and add features, they found the code was deeply tangled. Changes in one area broke others unexpectedly. Simple fixes required understanding complex chains of dependencies.

## Why it happened

AI models optimise for producing code that works, not code that is easy to change. The generated code contained:

- **Unnecessary complexity** where simpler approaches would have worked
- **Duplicated logic** spread across multiple files rather than shared through reusable functions
- **Tight coupling** between components that should have been independent

These issues were hard to spot in review because each individual file looked reasonable. The problems only became clear when the team tried to work with the code as a whole.

## The lesson

Review AI-generated code for maintainability, not just correctness. Ask whether the code can be understood, changed, and extended by the team. Look specifically for:

- functions doing too many things
- repeated patterns that should be abstracted
- hidden dependencies between modules
- overly clever solutions where straightforward ones would do

Build refactoring into your [workflow](/ai-practitioner-handbook/workflow). Do not assume that code which passes tests and review is ready for production without checking its long-term maintainability.
