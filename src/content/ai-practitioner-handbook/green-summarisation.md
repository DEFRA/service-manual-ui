Green summarisation focuses on creating text summaries using smaller, more energy-efficient models without losing quality.

## The challenge

Summarising long documents is a common AI task across Defra. Policy papers, consultation responses, and research reports all need clear summaries. However, using large models for every summary is wasteful when smaller ones can do the job well.

## The approach

This pattern uses lightweight models to produce concise summaries of documents. The key techniques include:

- **Pre-processing text** to remove boilerplate, headers, and formatting before sending it to the model
- **Chunking long documents** into manageable sections and summarising each independently
- **Using targeted prompts** that specify the exact format, length, and focus of the summary
- **Selecting the smallest capable model** that still produces accurate and readable output

## Results

Testing showed that smaller models produced summaries of comparable quality to larger ones for straightforward documents. Energy consumption per summary dropped significantly. Processing time also improved, allowing higher throughput.

## When to use this pattern

Green summarisation works well for standard document types with predictable structures. For highly technical or ambiguous content, a mid-range or advanced model may still be needed. Always validate summary accuracy against the source material.
