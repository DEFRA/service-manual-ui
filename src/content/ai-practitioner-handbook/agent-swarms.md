Agent swarms use multiple specialist AI agents working together to analyse complex documents. Each agent has a defined role, and they collaborate to produce comprehensive results.

## How it works

Instead of sending an entire document to a single model, the swarm approach divides the work across several focused agents:

- **Analysis agent** reads the document and identifies key themes, arguments, and data points
- **Fact-checking agent** verifies claims against known sources and flags unsupported statements
- **Summarisation agent** produces a concise overview based on the analysis and fact-checking outputs

An orchestrator coordinates the agents, passing outputs from one to the next and assembling the final result.

## Why use swarms

Single-model approaches struggle with long, complex documents. They can miss nuances, hallucinate facts, or lose track of context. By splitting responsibilities across agents, each one handles a narrower task with greater accuracy.

Swarms also allow you to use different model tiers for different roles. The fact-checking agent might need an advanced model, while the summarisation agent works well with a mid-range one.

## Considerations

Agent swarms add complexity to your system. You need to manage coordination, error handling, and data flow between agents. Start simple with two or three agents and expand only when the added complexity is justified by better results.

Monitor token usage across all agents. The total cost of a swarm can exceed a single large model call if not managed carefully. See [token optimisation](/ai-practitioner-handbook/token-optimisation) for ways to keep costs under control.
