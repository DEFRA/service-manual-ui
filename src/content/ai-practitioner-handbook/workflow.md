AI-assisted development follows a structured workflow. Each step builds on the last, keeping quality high and progress visible.

## Start with a product idea

Identify the problem you want to solve and the outcome you need. Write this down clearly before touching any code.

## Generate requirements

Use a thinking model to draft detailed functional and technical requirements. These become the foundation for everything that follows.

## Create a branch

Use git branching to isolate your work. This keeps the main codebase stable while you experiment and build.

## Generate code

Write prompts based on your requirements and let the AI produce code. Keep each prompt focused on a single function or component.

## Generate tests

Create tests from the requirements, not from the code. This ensures tests verify intended behaviour rather than just matching what was written. Generate tests independently so they act as a genuine check.

## Refactor

Review the generated code for clarity and maintainability. Simplify where needed. Remove duplication and tighten up naming.

## Update documentation

Keep documentation in step with the code. Record what changed, why it changed, and how it works.

## Code review

Have a team member review the changes. Check for correctness, readability, and alignment with project standards.

## Merge and deploy

Once approved, merge the branch and deploy through your standard pipeline. Monitor for issues after release.
