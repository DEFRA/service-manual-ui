## Getting started

Read about [product and delivery in the GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery).

You should also review the [Defra outcome delivery group model](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/Team177/SitePages/DDTS-Delivery-Groups.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=ajLnoX).

### Recruitment and resourcing

All product roles at Defra are recruited through the DDTS product profession.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p class="govuk-body">You must:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>contact the Head of Product to discuss your role requirements before you start recruiting</li>
    <li>follow the agreed product recruitment process</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Do not recruit product roles outside this process.

This ensures we hire suitably experienced specialists. It also prevents assigning product responsibilities to people without the right skills.

### Your delivery group

Defra delivers services through delivery groups. You must understand which delivery group your service belongs to and how it works.

Each delivery group has a strategic roadmap team that sets direction and priorities.

[Find a list of Delivery Groups and Leads on SharePoint](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team177/SitePages/Delivery-Groups-and-Leads.aspx).

If you are a delivery manager, identify your:

- delivery group lead
- delivery centre lead (this may be your programme delivery manager)
- profession leads within your delivery group

Arrange a meeting with your delivery centre lead or programme delivery manager. They will give you access to guidance and SharePoint repositories for your delivery.

**Product managers:** speak to your Lead Product Manager about direction, priorities, and alignment.

**Lead Product Managers:** speak to your delivery centre lead.

This ensures services align with delivery group priorities and decisions have the right oversight.
