## Getting started

Read the [product and delivery content in the GOV.UK service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery).

You should also familiarise yourself with the [Defra outcome delivery group model](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/Team177/SitePages/DDTS-Delivery-Groups.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=ajLnoX).

### Your delivery group

Determine which delivery group the service you are working on belongs to. You can find a list of [Delivery Groups and Leads on SharePoint](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team177/SitePages/Delivery-Groups-and-Leads.aspx).

You should identify your:

- delivery group lead
- delivery centre lead
- profession leads working within your delivery group

Arrange a meeting with your programme delivery manager. They will help you gain access to any specific guidance and SharePoint repositories which are relevant to your delivery.

## Join the community

If you are a product manager, [get in touch with the product community](mailto:product.management@defra.gov.uk).

Let them know if you are at Defra via resource augmentation or working with a specific supplier, and they will add you to the relevant product community.
