It isn't mandatory for a delivery group to use these assurances, but they should be included wherever possible.

## Show and tells

Show and tells enable teams to constantly share progress and to check they're meeting the right needs.

To run effective show and tells:

- invite stakeholders
- maintain a regular cadence
- tailor content to what the audience finds valuable

## Architectural assurance

Architectural assurance catches technical alignment issues early through regular engagement with the strategic technical lead.

Prototyping multiple options during alpha phases helps teams make informed decisions.

## Guardrail exceptions

When proposed solutions conflict with delivery or enterprise architecture standards, teams should seek approval to either:

- update the guidelines
- document a formal exception

## Change management

The approach to change management depends on the characteristics of the change.

Small, reversible modifications need minimal formality. Larger, complex changes require wider consultation so that any risks and impact can be understood.

## Private beta

Launching with a closed group of users reduces risk and assurance requirements.

Focus areas include:

- basic readiness checks
- testing to protect existing services

## Cross-cutting technical services

The cross-cutting technical services (CCTS) team helps services meet standards by:

- engaging early
- tracking progress
- collaborating with assessors on confidence levels
