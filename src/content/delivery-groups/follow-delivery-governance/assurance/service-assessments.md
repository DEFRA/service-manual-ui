A service assessment measures a service against the 14 points of the GOV.UK Service Standard. It's a peer review where service teams get guidance from specialist panelists.

## Services that need assessment

All transactional services need assessment. This includes services that:

- allow users to exchange information
- allow users to submit personal data that affects government records
- are internal services
- use commercial off-the-shelf software

Non-transactional services may need assessment depending on spend control decisions.

Service assessments look at whole services, not just products or platforms. If you add new components to an existing service, the whole service still needs assessment.

## When services are assessed

Assessments take place after:

- alpha phase
- private beta phase
- public beta phase

Discovery workshops may be run informally.

Services need assessment if they are:

- new services
- rebuilt services
- significantly restructured services
- services introducing new user groups or journeys

Lead assessors decide whether a service needs assessment in unclear cases.

Services do not need reassessment for continuous improvement or feature development.

## Assessment panels

Most Defra services are assessed by an internal panel.

Services are assessed by a cross-government panel if they:

- handle more than 100,000 transactions per year
- serve multiple organisations

The assessment structure remains unchanged despite governance modifications.
