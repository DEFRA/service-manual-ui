## Spend control in delivery groups

Spend control currently happens at each phase of service delivery. It ensures government departments get approval before spending government money on technology.

This process is changing. Regular reviews will take place within delivery groups instead. The spend control team will provide ongoing assurance.

## Recording spend

Delivery groups will centrally record service spend using the [get approval to spend tool](https://www.get-approval-to-spend.service.gov.uk/p/login). Spend must be recorded within 2 weeks of being committed.

Each piece of spend will be marked by the tool as:

- high risk
- medium risk
- low risk

Medium and low risk spend may or may not need to go to the programme assurance board (PAB), depending on other factors noted below.

## Quarterly spend review

The Defra spend control team will hold quarterly reviews with each delivery group. These reviews will check that:

- all spend has been declared
- spend has been declared on time
- spend aligns with strategy and standards
- spend is within the delegated authority approval limit
- spend follows the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice)
- recorded spend matches actual spend within the group
- service assessment needs have been met

Each piece of committed spend will be rated as:

- red (control) - requires immediate oversight
- amber (monitor) - needs monitoring
- green (assure) - can proceed without further review

## Spend review outcomes

Spend ratings affect approvals for the next quarter:

- Red rating or more than 3 amber ratings - all spend must go to project approval board
- Up to 3 amber ratings with no reds - only high and medium risk spend must go to project approval board
- All green ratings - the delivery group can assure all medium and low risk spend without approval from the project approval board
