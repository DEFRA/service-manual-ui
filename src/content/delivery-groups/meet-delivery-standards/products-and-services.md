## Why this matters

Successful delivery groups have a clear and current view of everything they're responsible for. This visibility prevents neglect and duplication, supports better decisions, and ensures resources are focused where they'll have the most impact.

Without a defined service map or inventory, groups operate blindly, unable to spot problems early or reuse existing assets, or make informed choices about where to focus effort.

## How we measure success

We use a red, amber, green (RAG) rating.

  <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--green govuk-!-margin-right-2">Green</strong>
  Clear, complete and current
</h3>

The group maintains a defined and up-to-date map of all services and products, with clear ownership, performance measures, and user journeys. Relationships between services and outcomes are explicit.

**You must be able to show:**

- service map or inventory exists showing all services
- each service has an owner
- relationships between services are understood
- services are linked to outcomes

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--yellow govuk-!-margin-right-2">Amber</strong>
  Partial or inconsistent view
</h3>

Some services are defined, but documentation is incomplete or ownership unclear. The connection between services and outcomes is only partially articulated.

**Common problems can include:**

- service map or inventory exists but is incomplete or out of date
- ownership unclear or disputed
- relationships between services not well understood
- services are not linked to outcomes

**To move to green, you should:**

- complete and update your service map or inventory
- assign clear owners for each service
- document relationships and dependencies between services
- explicitly link each service to delivery group outcomes

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red govuk-!-margin-right-2">Red</strong>
  No defined or coherent view of services
</h3>

There is no coherent view of services or products. Operations are fragmented across projects or systems, with unclear ownership or accountability.

**Common problems can include:**

- no service inventory or map exists
- different teams hold conflicting views of what services exist
- no clarity on ownership or accountability
- services operate in isolation, disconnected from outcomes
- work is managed as projects rather than ongoing services
