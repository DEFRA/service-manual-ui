## Why this matters

A clear roadmap helps delivery groups make better decisions and avoid conflicting priorities. Teams understand how their work contributes to bigger goals. This builds stakeholder confidence and motivates better performance.

Without a roadmap, delivery groups react to immediate pressures rather than working towards strategic goals. This creates confusion, wastes resources and damages stakeholder trust.

## How we measure success

We use a red, amber, green (RAG) rating.

  Clear roadmap with priorities and regular reviews
</h3>

The delivery group has a clear roadmap that shows how change initiatives connect to outcomes and existing services. Priorities are transparent and based on evidence.

**You must be able to show:**

- publish a roadmap that links change initiatives to outcomes and existing services
- use a clear process to prioritise work and changes to the roadmap
- have regular roadmap reviews
- ensure all team members understand the roadmap and their role in it

  Incomplete roadmap with unclear priorities
</h3>

A roadmap exists but lacks clear priorities or alignment to outcomes. Roadmaps change frequently without clear reasons.

**Common problems can include:**

- roadmap is high-level and lacks detail
- priorities are unclear or based on opinion rather than evidence
- roadmap changes frequently without clear reasons
- stakeholders do not understand or support the roadmap

**To move to green, you should:**

- add detail to your roadmap showing how initiatives link to outcomes and services
- establish a clear prioritisation process
- create a regular review cycle for roadmap updates
- ensure all team members understand the roadmap and communicate it to stakeholders

  No roadmap
</h3>

No roadmap exists. Change happens reactively in response to immediate pressures. There is limited visibility of future direction.

**Common problems can include:**

- no roadmap exists
- change happens reactively in response to immediate pressures
- different teams work on conflicting or duplicate change initiatives
- no clear connection between change activities and strategic outcomes
- stakeholders have different views of priorities and direction
