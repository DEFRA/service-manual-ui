## Why this matters

Success measures help delivery groups understand whether their work is achieving the intended outcomes. Clear, shared measures enable better decisions, accountability, and learning across teams. Transparent progress measures also allow teams to learn what's working and adapt plans quickly.

Without success measures, delivery groups risk focusing on activity rather than impact. This can lead to wasted effort, missed opportunities to learn, and uncertainty about whether outcomes are being achieved.

## How we measure success

We use a red, amber, green (RAG) rating.

  Clear measures with transparent reporting
</h3>

The delivery group has defined and shared measurable indicators of success linked to outcomes. Data is collected, analysed, and published openly with stakeholders at regular intervals. Progress is used to inform decisions, support learning, and adjust plans.

**You must be able to show:**

- measurable indicators of success are defined and shared for each outcome
- measures are clearly linked to delivery group outcomes, not just activity
- performance data is analysed and discussed regularly
- progress updates and insights are published and accessible to stakeholders
- data is used to inform decisions and roadmap prioritisation

  Partial measures or inconsistent reporting
</h3>

Some measures exist, but they are incomplete or not clearly linked to outcomes. Progress reporting is inconsistent or lacks sufficient insight to guide decisions.

**Common problems can include:**

- measures focus on outputs (for example, number of releases) rather than outcomes (for example, improved user satisfaction)
- data is collected irregularly or not analysed effectively
- progress reporting happens infrequently or only within teams
- limited use of data to inform decisions and roadmap prioritisation
- stakeholders have differing understandings of success

**To move to green, you should:**

- define focused measures that clearly link to delivery group outcomes
- establish regular data collection and analysis processes
- create consistent progress reporting schedules and formats
- use performance data to inform roadmap decisions and prioritisation
- ensure all stakeholders understand and agree on success measures

  No defined measures or progress tracking
</h3>

No success measures are defined or shared. Progress is judged subjectively or through anecdotal evidence. There is little understanding of whether outcomes are being achieved.

**Common problems can include:**

- no defined measures of success or performance indicators
- progress updates are infrequent or missing
- decisions are made without evidence or data
- success is judged by outputs or effort, not outcomes
- teams and stakeholders lack a shared understanding of progress
