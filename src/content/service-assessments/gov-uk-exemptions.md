All new digital services must be designed for hosting on GOV.UK and meet the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

This guidance explains what goes on GOV.UK and how to request an exemption.

## Does my service need to go on GOV.UK?

GOV.UK is for services and information that only government can provide. It is designed to make interacting with government simple, so users do not need to understand government structure.

### What must go on GOV.UK

Content and products owned by government must go on GOV.UK if they meet a proven user need.

Your content must help users do one of the following:

- use a government service
- understand policy for a specific sector
- find out about a government policy
- understand the government’s response to a major event
- follow the law
- apply for a government support scheme
- find out about business opportunities
- understand government priorities

If your service involves policies managed by multiple departments, you must consult them. Contact the GDS GOV.UK Content team for help with complex user journeys.

### What does not go on GOV.UK

Your content or service must not go on GOV.UK if it:

- is from an organisation that is not part of central government
- gives commercial advantage to an organisation
- gives advice better provided by a non-governmental organisation
- is party political
- is for internal work management (use the intranet)
- is only relevant to devolved administrations
- duplicates other content on GOV.UK

## How to request an exemption

Email [serviceassessments@defra.gov.uk](mailto:serviceassessments@defra.gov.uk) with:

- Subject: `Exemption request: [Service Name]`
- Why the user need cannot be met on GOV.UK (with evidence)
- Proposed domain name

### After you request an exemption

The DTSA team will review your request. This can take up to 8 weeks.

**Do not begin procurement of an external website until your request is approved.**
