Service assessments are performed by either:

- internal Defra assessors
- a cross-government panel

The type of assessment depends on your transaction volume.

If your service has **over 100,000 transactions per year**, it will be assessed by a cross-government panel. Services with fewer transactions are assessed internally by a Defra panel.

The Digital and Technology Standards (DTSA) team arranges all assessments.

## How to book

Internal assessors are volunteers, so availability may be limited.

**Book your assessment at least 6 weeks in advance.** We aim to book an appointment within a 2-week window of your requested date.

Email [serviceassessments@defra.gov.uk](mailto:serviceassessments@defra.gov.uk) with:

- Name of the service
- Assessment type (Alpha or Beta)
- Brief summary of the service
- Preferred 2-week period for the assessment
