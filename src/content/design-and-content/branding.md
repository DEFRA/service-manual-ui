Services must look and feel like government services so users trust them, but Defra services have specific branding requirements.

## Services not on GOV.UK

Services hosted on domains that are not GOV.UK **must not** look exactly like GOV.UK.

### You must not use

- The "New Transport" font
- The GOV.UK header or Crown logo
- The GOV.UK footer

### You must use

- **Font:** Helvetica or Arial CSS font stacks
- **Header:** The Defra header (or agency equivalent/logo)
- **Logo:** The Defra logo (or agency logo)
- **Footer:** The Defra footer (or agency equivalent)

For internal services or external sites not on GOV.UK, use the Defra page templates.

## Colours

Colours should be consistent with the [GOV.UK frontend palette](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/).

### Department colours

You can use the Defra specific colours sparingly, for example in headers or navigation borders.

| Colour      | Hex       |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Defra Green | `#00a33b` |

{: .govuk-table}

**Accessibility:** You must make sure that the contrast ratio of text and interactive elements meets [WCAG 2.2 level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

^ Check the [Defra Design Standards on GitHub](https://github.com/DEFRA/design-standards) for the latest templates and assets.

## Logos

For external facing sites not on GOV.UK, you must use a Defra or supporting agency logo.

- Organisation logos must be included as an SVG where possible.
- The crest image itself must be ignored by screen readers.
- Links in the logo must be focusable and usable with keyboards and assistive technology.
