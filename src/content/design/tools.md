## Prototyping tools

Use prototypes to get valuable feedback and insights from user research or the people you work with.

The [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/) allows you to quickly make interactive, accessible and realistic prototypes of GOV.UK services.

- [Tutorials and guides for GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/tutorials-and-examples)

### Save time with templates and components

The kit comes with templates to create common page types.

You can also copy example code from the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to add styles, components and patterns into your prototype. This means you can:

- create prototypes quickly and easily
- learn from the research and experience of other service teams
- avoid repeating work that's already been done

**NOTE:** For security reasons, you won't be able to use your Defra supplied laptop for prototyping using the GOV.UK prototype kit. You'll need to use a different machine for this purpose. You won't need VPN or SSH / GPG keys.

### Mural

Mural is the Defra approved tool for whiteboarding and low-fidelity prototyping. Defra has an enterprise license. [To get started log into Mural with your Defra email address](https://app.mural.co/signin).

### Figma

Figma can be used for low to medium fidelity prototyping. If you are working at Defra via a supplier, you'll need your own license. When you've finished your assignment, you should export your Figma files and give them to your team. If required, the files can be stored in the Defra Figma instance.

## Version control, deployments, and hosting

Defra designers use a Defra **GitHub** repo for version control and code deployments, and a dedicated **Heroku** account for publishing prototypes. For details of these, and how to gain access, please email <a href="mailto:DesignOps@defra.gov.uk">DesignOps@defra.gov.uk</a> or post a message in Slack [#prototype-kit-support](https://defra-digital.slack.com/archives/C06HH978YJ3).

### The steps for setting up Github and Heroku

1. Make sure you have a Github account and know your username.
2. Request a repo to be set up on Defra Design Github. Share the name for the repo you require and your username so it can be added to the repo.
3. When you have installed the prototype kit onto the repo and have then submitted the first version of your prototype request a Heroku app to be set up.
4. If you want a specific password, share with the person setting the app up for you.
5. If you need the password changing request the change at either of above contact points.

**NB:** Defra Design team don't provide Heroku access to team members.

## Design histories

### What is a design history?

A design history is like a blog. It records updates about how a service has been developed. This includes new features, changes to existing ones, and findings from user research. It should contain anything your team may need to refer back to later.

Government services change over time. They're improved, rebuilt and iterated as teams learn more about users. People join and leave teams, and it becomes harder to explain why certain decisions were made. Without a clear record, context and research are lost and the reasoning behind design choices becomes unclear.

A design history helps teams understand why a service works the way it does.

During alpha and beta, you should keep a design history for your project using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. Share it regularly with your team and make sure it is handed over to your delivery manager when you leave.

## Defra Forms

Build accessible, GOV.UK-styled forms for your digital service at Defra.

### When to use Defra Forms

Defra Forms has tools to help you:

- collect information from users through simple online forms
- change forms to meet your needs, or quickly add new forms to your service

[Read more about Defra forms](https://service-manual-ui.dev.cdp-int.defra.cloud/architecture-and-software-development/defra-forms) or [email the Defra forms team](mailto:defraforms@defra.gov.uk).

## Project management and collaboration

**Jira** and **Confluence** are used extensively at Defra for project management and collaboration. Please ask your project team for more information.
