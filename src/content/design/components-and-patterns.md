Design patterns solve common problems so teams can focus on the things unique to their service and its users.

Check the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to see if the component or pattern you need is already being used in government.

If you cannot find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System, you can:

1. [See if it is being worked on by other teams across government](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/) and add your findings
2. Ask if it is being worked on by someone in Defra – Email: <a href="mailto:DesignOps@defra.gov.uk">DesignOps@defra.gov.uk</a>
3. Check other departments for [design patterns and design resources](https://github.com/ctdesign/gov-design-systems-list)
4. Propose a new pattern - Email: <a href="mailto:DesignOps@defra.gov.uk">DesignOps@defra.gov.uk</a>
5. [Propose a new pattern in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/)

All patterns must be [useful and unique](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#new-proposals).
