A prototype allows the team to test and explore ideas before developing them. You can share ideas with users early and often, so that you can find issues with the design and make improvements based on user research.

**Prototyping is important because it:**

- helps you to make sure you're building the right service for your users
- helps your whole team to get a shared understanding about the future of your service
- allows your team to explore design ideas much faster and at lower risk than using your production code

There are different types of prototypes that you should use at different stages of your design - from sketches to code prototypes using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/).

You must use prototypes to [pass your service assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-prototypes#when-to-use-prototypes).
