## Maps

All essential geographic information must be available in a non-visual format, such as text or a list.

Maps should be used as visual enhancements for people who choose to use them.

Only use interactive maps when there is a clear user need.

`InteractiveMap` is a lightweight map component designed for public-facing government services, and available for anyone to use. Built to GOV.UK standards, with accessibility at its core, `InteractiveMap` supports a wide range of users across abilities, devices and input methods. It is open source and works with multiple mapping engines.

The component can be extended through plugins to meet the specific needs of a service.

**This project is currently in beta and is not yet stable. Documentation and support are not yet available.**

## Charts and graphs

All essential data must be available in a non-visual format, such as text or a table.

Charts and graphs should be used as visual enhancements for people who choose to use them.
