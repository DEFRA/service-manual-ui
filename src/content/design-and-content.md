All Defra services must meet the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). This applies to public-facing services, internal systems, and those on domains that are not GOV.UK.

## Inclusive design

We design for everyone. Our principles are:

- **Inclusive:** safe, easy, and dignified for everyone
- **Responsive:** based on what people say they need
- **Flexible:** usable in different ways
- **Convenient:** requiring minimal effort
- **Welcoming:** free of disabling barriers

## Internal services

Internal services and case management tools must be consistent across Defra. Standardisation makes systems easier to use and training faster.

If you buy products from external suppliers, they must meet the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice).
