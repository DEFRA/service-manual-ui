Defra uses business analysts (BAs) in all phases of delivery, from Discovery to Live. They align with the [Government Digital and Data role description](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/business-analyst).

## Role of a business analyst

Business analysts help teams to:

- understand business problems and opportunities
- research how a business area works, including its people, processes, data and technology
- identify improvements and feasible options
- analyse the effects of change and define success measures
- identify user and business needs to help design services
- make prioritisation decisions using analysis-led insights
- ensure products meet business and user needs
- understand business and policy constraints

## Getting started

Contact your Delivery Group Principal Business Analyst. They will:

- provide an overview of the Delivery Group
- explain domain knowledge and governance
- arrange access to tools and sites

Find your Principal BA on the [Delivery Group BAs SharePoint site](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team924/SitePages/What-We-are-working-On.aspx).
