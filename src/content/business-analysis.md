Defra uses business analysts (BAs) in all phases of delivery, from Discovery to Live. They align with the [Government Digital and Data role description](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/business-analyst).

## Getting started

You should read:

- [DDTS Business Analysis](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team924/SitePages/Business-Analysis-Page.aspx) - for general guidance and community updates
