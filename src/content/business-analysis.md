Defra uses business analysts (BAs) in all phases of delivery, from Discovery to Live. They align with the [Government Digital and Data role description](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/business-analyst).

## Getting started

You should read:

- [DDTS Business Analysis](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team924/SitePages/Business-Analysis-Page.aspx) - for general guidance and community updates
- [BA Toolkit](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team924/SitePages/BA-Toolkit.aspx) - for templates, tools, and methods
- [BA repository](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team924/Lists/DDTS) - to store and find project artifacts

## Join the community

Contact your Delivery Group Principal Business Analyst. They will:

- provide an overview of the Delivery Group
- explain domain knowledge and governance
- arrange access to tools and sites

Find your Principal BA on the [Delivery Group BAs SharePoint site](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team924/SitePages/What-We-are-working-On.aspx).
