The delivery group standards help teams run successful delivery groups. These standards ensure delivery groups have:

- clarity on their outcomes
- understanding of their current services
- clear roadmaps for change
- methods to measure the impact of change

## The standards

### 1. Define and share outcomes

Set a small number of clear outcomes and make sure everyone understands them.

[Read about defining and sharing outcomes](/delivery-group-standards/define-and-share-outcomes)

### 2. Maintain a service inventory

Maintain a clear, up-to-date list of all your services and who owns them.

### 3. Publish a roadmap for change

Create a clear, prioritised roadmap showing how you'll evolve to deliver better outcomes.

### 4. Define success measures and share progress

Define and share clear measures of success so everyone can see whether outcomes are being achieved.
