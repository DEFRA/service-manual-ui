Defra adheres to the cross-government [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). All services must meet the standard's 15 points.

To meet point 5 of the Service Standard, your software or service must conform to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2** at level **AA**.

## Why it's important

Services must be accessible to everyone who needs to use them. This includes people who use assistive technologies, such as screen readers, voice recognition software, or screen magnifiers.

Accessibility is also a legal requirement. The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018 require public sector services to meet accessibility standards. The Equality Act 2010 also places a duty on public bodies to make reasonable adjustments.

## What it means

Your service must meet WCAG 2.2 level AA and work with common assistive technologies. This applies to all services with a human interface, whether they are for the public, specialist users, or Defra staff.

**Public-facing services** must work with the technologies listed in the [GDS testing with assistive technologies guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).

**Staff-facing software** must work with the assistive technologies currently used within Defra:

- Dragon (voice recognition)
- Read and Write (screen reader and dyslexia aid)
- ZoomText (screen magnifier)
- JAWS (screen reader)
- Microsoft Windows Voice Access, Magnifier, and Narrator

### Exemptions

You are exempt only if the software is:

- used solely as a backend (for example, a database or server)
- accessed only via a command line interface (CLI), code editor, or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

If you are unsure, assume you must follow the standards.

### Common misunderstandings

- **Internal use:** Staff software is not exempt. It must meet the same standards as public services.
- **Maps:** Maps are not exempt. You must provide the information in an accessible digital format.
- **No complaints:** A lack of complaints does not mean your service is accessible or legal.
