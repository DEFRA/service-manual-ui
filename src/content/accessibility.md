## What this standard is about

Meeting accessibility standards is about creating services that are inclusive for all users. It is covered in [point 5 of the cross-government GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service) and is a legal requirement for all Defra services.

## Why it's important

Designing with accessibility at the forefront has benefits for all users.

Anyone can face barriers using your service. These barriers are often referred to as universal barriers. Universal barriers include matters such as a user’s trust and access levels, through to their surrounding environment and personal circumstances.

Legislation is also in place to make sure that accessibility requirements are met. This includes The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018 and The Equality Act 2010.

## What you need to do

Your service must meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at level AA. It should also be compatible with common assistive technologies, such as screen readers, voice recognition software, or screen magnifiers.

This applies to all services with a human interface, whether they are for the public, specialist users, or Defra staff.

Public-facing services must work with the technologies listed in the [GDS testing with assistive technologies guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).

Staff-facing software must work with the assistive technologies currently used within Defra. This can include:

- Dragon (voice recognition)
- Read and Write (screen reader and dyslexia aid)
- ZoomText (screen magnifier)
- JAWS (screen reader)
- Microsoft Windows Voice Access, Magnifier, and Narrator

## When accessibility exemptions apply

You are exempt only if the software is:

- used solely as a backend (for example, a database or server)
- accessed only via a command line interface (CLI), code editor, or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

If you are unsure, assume you must follow the standards.

## Common misunderstandings about accessibility

Designing an accessible service needs to be factored into each stage of delivery. The following misunderstandings are not reasons why accessibility requirements shouldn’t be met:

- **Your service is for internal use only:** Staff software must meet the same standards as public services.
- **Maps are exempt:** You must provide essential information in an accessible non-visual format, such as text or a list.
- **No complaints have been made:** A lack of complaints does not mean your service is accessible or legal.
