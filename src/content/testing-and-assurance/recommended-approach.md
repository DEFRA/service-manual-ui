DDTS have a [Software Development and QA policy](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/fabc6d0e-2ac8-e4e4-8987-c8f21f3aaea9/a/14595940-f09d-4fb2-b851-4f2c5d63cfb0?tenantId=770a2450-0227-4c62-90c7-4e38537f1102&action=viewdetails&source=ViewControlledContentURL&p=true&lit=59091). We adopt a [risk based approach test strategy](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/def-contentcloud/_layouts/15/DocIdRedir.aspx?ID=CONTENTCLOUD-190616497-19963), accepting that testers and time are a finite resource.

Test Assurance can be used to underpin some of that rationale. Where projects or programmes are not reaching expected standards, the risk will be heightened and remediation plans are put in place.

Following these artefacts will help your team deliver services to the quality Defra demands:
