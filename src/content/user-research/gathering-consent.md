## Why get informed consent

Informed consent ensures:

- ensure participants decide voluntarily
- meet ethical and legal standards
- comply with data protection law
- follow [Market Research Society](https://www.mrs.org.uk/standards) and [GOV.UK Service Manual standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research)

Consent is only valid if it is **freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous**.

More detailed explanations are available in the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research) and [ICO's guidance on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/).

## What informed consent involves

You must explain:

- participation is voluntary
- who is doing the research
- the purpose of the research
- what the research will involve for them
- any foreseeable risks to the participants
- what types of data will be collected
- how you'll handle their personal data
- their rights including withdrawing and complaining
- how the research will be shared and who with
- that there may be observers
- that video or audio recordings may be made (if applicable)

## Keeping evidence of consent

Keep a record of what participants were told and what they consented to. [This is a legal requirement](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/#ib2).

Check these records before sharing any participant data (like session recordings).

Store consent forms alongside the data they cover so they can be easily matched.

## Withdrawing consent

Participants have the right to withdraw consent at any time, even years after their session. Some withdrawing participants will allow data already collected to still be used while others will want to withdraw entirely.

If the participant wishes to withdraw entirely then all their personally identifiable data must be deleted. [This is required by data protection law](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/#ib2). Data that has already been included in analysis or [research findings can only be kept if it is fully anonymised](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4018606/chapter-2-anonymisation-draft.pdf).

## When participants are Defra staff

When your research participants are staff working for Defra group organisations, you still need to get informed consent.

## Using the Defra template

### The process

1.  **Get the latest version of the template** when starting a new phase of research.
2.  **Create your form(s)** from the template.
3.  **Tailor your form(s)** to your current research work.
4.  **Send the form** to each participant ahead of their research session (or give them time at the start).
5.  **Keep the completed forms** as legal records of consent.

### When to use

## What to do with completed forms (legal records of consent)

We must keep a record of exactly what participants were told and exactly what they consented to. [This is a legal requirement](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/#ib2). These records need to be kept alongside the research data they cover (such as recordings) so that they can be matched up.

If your project is using UR Vaults, then save completed forms to the consent forms sub-folder within the folder for the round of research. If not using UR Vaults, then save in your project's equivalent secure location.

### When using Microsoft Word forms

If using the Microsoft Word template, then set each participant's completed Word doc to [read-only](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/make-a-document-read-only-5c25909c-46d9-4eb0-9d1f-d072a560e340) and save alongside the research data.

Where participants filled it in on paper, then scan to PDF with an office printer. Alternatively, photograph using the Microsoft Office Lens smartphone app to create a single PDF from a series of photos.

### When using Qualtrics forms

You need to export completed consent forms from Qualtrics. Qualtrics alone is not sufficient for record-keeping because the forms cannot be easily matched against research data, and Qualtrics accounts get deleted when researchers move on.

1.  **Open your consent form(s)** in Qualtrics.
2.  **Print a copy of the form's wording to PDF**:
    - Survey tab > Tools drop-down > Import/Export > Print survey > Save as PDF.
    - Don't worry about how ugly the PDF looks but make sure all pages and text are included.
3.  **Save the PDF** into the UR Vault (or equivalent). Put it into the folder for that round of research alongside the session recordings or other data.
    - This will act as the legal record of what participants were told.
4.  **Go back to Qualtrics** to export the form data submitted by participants to Excel:
    - Data & Analysis tab > Export & Import > Excel > Download.
    - This will act as the legal record of what participants agreed to.
5.  **Save the Excel file** alongside the PDF file.
    - Name the PDF and Excel the same so it is clear they relate.
    - Don't forget to export the data again if you end up doing more sessions with the same consent form.
6.  **Repeat** for all the consent forms you created for your current research work.

## Get this template

Defra DDTS's user research consent form template is available in these formats:

- Qualtrics web form
- Microsoft Word document

### Qualtrics web form

<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    Only use this template with Defra's Qualtrics. Use on other Qualtrics accounts will break some features and create data protection issues.

#### Tips to avoid messing up the Qualtrics form

The template presets various Qualtrics survey settings for optimal security, accessibility and usability. If you're unsure whether you should change a setting, check with Research Operations.

If you're unfamiliar with Qualtrics then you might accidentally mess up the form template, particularly text formatting. Follow the [top tips on Using Qualtrics for user research](/user-research/using-qualtrics).

  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    <p>If you have a Defra laptop / email address then you can request a Qualtrics account by following the <a href="/user-research/using-qualtrics">instructions on Using Qualtrics for user research</a>.</p>
    <p>If you're from a supplier (like Cognizant, Capgemini) without a Defra laptop then either:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>ask your DDTS programme/delivery manager to get you a Defra laptop (highly recommended)</li>
      <li>ask Research Operations to create consent forms on your behalf (you'll be able to view submitted forms on your company device)</li>
      <li>use the Microsoft Word template</li>

### Microsoft Word document

For best results, edit the downloaded file in the MS Word desktop app rather than in your web browser.

Pick the relevant version:

- **Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs** ([Download](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/template-consent-form-for-user-research.aspx#microsoft-word-document))
- If the Defra group body your research is for is not listed, please [contact Research Operations](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/retired-contact-user-research-operations.aspx).
