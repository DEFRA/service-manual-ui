## Use Defra’s user research panels (preferred)

Defra has panels for:

- [Farming panel](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/research-panels.aspx#farming-panel)
- [Circular economy (resources and waste) panel](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/research-panels.aspx#circular-economy-panel)

### Process for researchers

1. **Contact the panel manager** to check feasibility and timelines.
2. **Submit a brief** detailing the participants you need.
3. **Manage consent**: You are responsible for your own consent forms.
4. **Record sessions**: If you are a supplier, you need a `defra.gov.uk` email address to record sessions.
5. **Share outputs**: You may need to share findings with the research library.

## Use recruitment agencies

<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
  <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
    <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
      When to use an agency
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    <p><strong>Consider using an agency when:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you lack time or resources to source participants</li>
      <li>you need to reach seldom-heard groups</li>
      <li>you need to offer financial incentives</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Do not use an agency if:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you can find participants via existing channels</li>
      <li>you have no budget</li>
      <li>project timescales are too short (agencies often need 2+ weeks)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

Approach agencies several weeks in advance. Define the problem clearly before commissioning.

## Recruit via networking

You can use professional networks or external organisations (trade associations, charities) to find participants.

### Referral campaigns

<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
  <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
    <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
       How referral campaigns work
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    <p>Ask stakeholders to refer potential participants. This leverages existing trust.</p>
    <p><strong>Be aware of bias:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Selection bias:</strong> Referred people may share characteristics.</li>
      <li><strong>Social desirability bias:</strong> Participants may try to please the referrer.</li>
      <li><strong>Acquiescence bias:</strong> Participants may agree with statements to please the researcher or the referrer, rather than expressing their true opinions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mitigate this by diversifying sources and using neutral language.</p>
  </div>
</details>

### Events

Consult your engagement team to find relevant events. If you attend, you **must complete a health and safety risk assessment** first.

## Social media

Communication teams per programme will have official accounts which you may be able to use for recruitment.

However, in cases where you may not be allowed, you will need to use personal social media accounts for communications.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  When using social media for user research recruitment, be aware your profile will be viewed by members of the public. You may need to be cautious when dealing with members of the public.

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Share a screener or panel link</li>
      <li>Explain goals and experience</li>
      <li>Describe what is involved</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-half">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Don't</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Message individuals privately</li>
      <li>Join private groups to recruit</li>
      <li>Conduct research in public posts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Incentives

Use incentives at your discretion. They must be peer-reviewed and signed off.

If you want to use an agency to pay participants you have recruited yourself, find out about [using incentives for user research](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/incentives-for-user-research.aspx).

**Indicative rates:**

- **Citizens**: £50–£75 (1 hour)
- **Business professionals**: £60–£80
- **Accessibility sessions**: Higher rates may apply

### Participant queries and consent

Provide clear info on payment methods and timing. Use the incentive consent form template (Word) and explain how payments might affect means-tested benefits.

Email [DDTSUserResearchOperations@defra.gov.uk](mailto:DDTSUserResearchOperations@defra.gov.uk) with any questions.
