## Use Defra’s user research panels (preferred)

Defra has panels for:

- Farming
- Circular Economy (Resources and Waste)

### Process for researchers

1. **Contact the panel manager** to check feasibility and timelines.
2. **Submit a brief** detailing the participants you need.
3. **Manage consent**: You are responsible for your own consent forms.
4. **Record sessions**: If you are a supplier, you need a `defra.gov.uk` email address to record sessions.
5. **Share outputs**: You may need to share findings with the research library.

## Use recruitment agencies

<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
  <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
    <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
      When to use an agency
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    <p><strong>Consider using an agency when:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you lack time or resources to source participants</li>
      <li>you need to reach seldom-heard groups</li>
      <li>you need to offer financial incentives</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Do not use an agency if:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you can find participants via existing channels</li>
      <li>you have no budget</li>
      <li>project timescales are too short (agencies often need 2+ weeks)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

Approach agencies several weeks in advance. Define the problem clearly before commissioning.

## Recruit via networking

You can use professional networks or external organisations (trade associations, charities) to find participants.

### Referral campaigns

<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
  <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
    <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
       How referral campaigns work
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    <p>Ask stakeholders to refer potential participants. This leverages existing trust.</p>
    <p><strong>Be aware of bias:</strong></p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Selection bias:</strong> Referred people may share characteristics.</li>
      <li><strong>Social desirability bias:</strong> Participants may try to please the referrer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mitigate this by diversifying sources and using neutral language.</p>
  </div>
</details>

### Events

Consult your engagement team to find relevant events. If you attend, you **must complete a health and safety risk assessment** first.

## Social media

Social media (like LinkedIn) is **not widely used** due to reputation risks. Use official programme accounts if necessary.

  <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-half">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Do</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Share a link to a screener</li>
      <li>Explain what’s involved</li>
      <li>Ask trade associations to help</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-half">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Don't</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Message individuals privately</li>
      <li>Join private groups to recruit</li>
      <li>Conduct research in public posts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Incentives

Use incentives at your discretion. They must be peer-reviewed and signed off.

**Indicative rates:**

- **Citizens**: £50–£75 (1 hour)
- **Business professionals**: £60–£80
- **Accessibility sessions**: Higher rates may apply
