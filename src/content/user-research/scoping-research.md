The User Researcher runs this stage. They consult programme stakeholders and User Research Leads.

## Why we do this

Agree the purpose of the upcoming research. Set the boundaries of what you will and will not cover.

Turn assumptions into research questions. Identify priority user groups, constraints, and early risks.

By the end, the team should agree on:

- the evidence needed
- the decisions that evidence will inform
- a first draft research plan
- a short scope summary

## Before you start

Describe the programme goals and the problem to solve.

Hold a planning workshop with stakeholders. Capture research questions, assumptions, and hypotheses.

## Methods

Use the [Defra Mural template](https://app.mural.co/t/coredefra2548/template/8a9926bd-e418-47f3-b387-d23b329a2bc7) to run a collaborative workshop. This allows you to:

- capture and prioritise research questions
- convert assumptions into testable questions

## Artefacts

Create a **Defra research scope summary** as the master reference. It should set out:

- purpose and goals
- questions, assumptions, and hypotheses
- user groups
- suitable methods
- logistics
- risks and mitigations
- approvals and next steps

Store materials in the team’s approved UR Vault or repository. Restrict access if personal data is involved.
