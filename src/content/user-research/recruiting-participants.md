## Recruitment panels

Recruitment panels are managed groups of research participants who have consented to future contact.

### Using existing panels

Check if an existing panel covers your user group. Defra has panels for:

- [Farming](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/research-panels.aspx#farming-panel)
- [Circular economy (resources and waste)](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/research-panels.aspx#circular-economy-panel)

Contact Research Operations to avoid duplication.

### Building a new panel

Only build a new panel if:

- no existing panels cover your user group
- you need access to a niche or hard-to-reach group
- you are running a long-term service with repeated research needs

You must contact Research Operations for approval.

## Using a recruitment screener

Use a screener to add participants to a panel or fill in missing info.
Defra uses Qualtrics for screeners.

Include links to:

- the Defra research privacy notice
- your Qualtrics accessibility statement

Remove data from Qualtrics every 3 months. Move it to your secure panel storage.

</details>

### Short screeners

Use short screeners when:

- the audience has limited time (e.g. at events)
- you already understand the user group
- you want to generate interest
- you need to refresh consent

## Screening offline

At events, you can:

- print the screener
- collect business cards
- use a QR code

Document all offline info. You must be able to trace consent.

## Special category data

If you ask about protected characteristics:

1.  Be clear about **why** you need it.
2.  Explain **how** you will use it.
3.  Obtain **explicit consent**.

### Age

Use Defra’s age bands:

- Under 18
- 18–25
- 26–35
- 36–45
- 46–55
- 56–65
- 65+

**Note**: Defra applies a strict position for 16-17 year olds. Secure parental consent.

## Accessibility and disability

Use [inclusive language](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/inclusive-language-words-to-use-and-avoid-when-writing-about-disability#:~:text=Don%27t%20automatically%20refer%20to%2cif%20it%20seems%20more%20appropriate). Identifying access needs helps identify barriers.

    <p><strong>1. Do you consider yourself to have an impairment, condition or access need?</strong></p>

       <li>Cognitive or memory impairment (for example, dementia)</li>
       <li>Other</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

### Assistive Technology

Ask about tools when testing service compatibility.

**When to ask:**

- to ensure compatibility with specific tools
- to screen for users of specific assistive technologies
- to understand how users interact with services

**When not to ask:**

- if you focus on broader user experiences
- if specific tool usage is not essential to your objectives

## Digital inclusion

We use the term **digital inclusion** rather than **digital literacy**. Digital literacy focuses on skills, while digital inclusion considers access, confidence, motivation, and barriers.

Use the [Digital Inclusion Scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to understand users’ needs.

### Why we do not use self-assessment

Defra does not use universal self-assessment questions in screeners. They are often inaccurate because:

- people overestimate or underestimate their skills
- terms are open to interpretation
- grid-style formats are not accessible
- digital skills change quickly

### How to assess digital inclusion

Assess digital inclusion during research sessions instead. Use:

- **Observation**: Watch users interact with services.
- **Context**: Consider the environment, device, and motivation.
- **Barriers**: Identify what prevents access (cost, connectivity, confidence).
