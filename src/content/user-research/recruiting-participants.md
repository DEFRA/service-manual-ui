## Recruitment panels

Recruitment panels are managed groups of research participants who have consented to future contact.

### Using existing panels

Check if an existing panel covers your user group. Defra has panels for:

- Farming
- Circular economy (resources and waste)

Contact Research Operations to avoid duplication.

### Building a new panel

Only build a new panel if:

- no existing panels cover your user group
- you need access to a niche or hard-to-reach group
- you are running a long-term service with repeated research needs

You must contact Research Operations for approval.

## Using a recruitment screener

Use a screener to add participants to a panel or fill in missing info.
Defra uses Qualtrics for screeners.

Include links to:

- the Defra research privacy notice
- your Qualtrics accessibility statement

REMOVE data from Qualtrics every 3 months. Move it to your secure panel storage.

  </div>
</details>

### Short screeners

Use short screeners when:

- the audience has limited time (e.g. at events)
- you already understand the user group
- you want to generate interest
- you need to refresh consent

## Screening offline

At events, you can:

- print the screener
- collect business cards
- use a QR code

Document all offline info. You must be able to trace consent.

## Special category data

If you ask about protected characteristics:

1.  Be clear about **why** you need it.
2.  Explain **how** you will use it.
3.  Obtain **explicit consent**.

### Consent question

> "To help us develop more inclusive and accessible services, we’d like to ask you some optional questions about any accessibility needs. Some questions may be sensitive. We will process your data in line with Defra’s research privacy notice and only use it for user research. Do you consent to Defra processing this data?"

- [ ] Yes, I consent
- [ ] No, I do not consent (skip this section)

### Age

Use Defra’s age bands:

- Under 18
- 18–25
- 26–35
- 36–45
- 46–55
- 56–65
- 65+

**Note**: Defra applies a strict position for 16-17 year olds. Secure parental consent.

## Accessibility and disability

Use inclusive language. Identifying access needs helps identify barriers.

       <li>Cognitive or memory impairment (for example, dementia)</li>
       <li>Other</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### Assistive Technology

Ask about tools when testing service compatibility.

        <li>Alternative input devices</li>
        <li>Text-to-speech software</li>
        <li>High contrast or colour inversion settings</li>

    </ul>

## Digital inclusion

We do not use self-assessment questions for digital literacy because they are often inaccurate.

Instead, assess digital inclusion during research sessions through:

- **Observation**: Watch users interact with services.
- **Context**: Consider environment and device.
- **Barriers**: Identify what prevents access (cost, connectivity, confidence).
