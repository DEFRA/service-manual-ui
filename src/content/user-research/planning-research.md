This stage is mandatory.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  Every piece of user research in Defra must have a research plan.
</div>

## Why we do this

Make the aims and scope of the research clear.

Turn assumptions into research questions. Identify risks and coordinate with other Defra research.

The plan should describe:

- who the participants are
- which methods you will use
- what evidence will inform decisions

## Output

You will have a drafted research plan. It shows how the team will use findings to make decisions.

Share the plan with the Lead User Researcher and Research Operations.

Store plans in Defra’s Data Vault.

    <p><strong>Lead User Researcher</strong>: Accountable for assuring the plan. Must review it.</p>

    <p><strong>Research Operations</strong>: Provide assurance on recruitment, tooling, and data handling.</p>
    <p><strong>Ethics Board</strong>: Review plans for higher risk topics, vulnerable users, or complex methods.</p>
    <p>Depending on risk, you may need an additional Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).</p>

## Methods

Use the [Defra template user research plan](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/Team2730/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE7AA60FA-E3D5-40AF-8E79-34EC4E21EBDB%7D&file=DDTS-UR-Defra-UserResearchPlan.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true). Use this for any work managed or assured by Defra DDTS.

Create a plan at the start of each project phase (like Discovery or Alpha). Create more frequent plans for complex activities.

Consult your project team and stakeholders while drafting the plan.

### Peer review

Ask a Defra Lead User Researcher to peer review your draft. They will:

- help coordinate with other research
- suggest improvements
- spot issues or gaps

Once your research plan is firm, email it to [DDTSUserResearchOperations@defra.gov.uk](mailto:DDTSUserResearchOperations@defra.gov.uk) with your [data protection screening form](https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team2730/SitePages/set-up-data-protection-measures-for-user-research.aspx#step-5-%E2%80%93-screen-your-research-plan-for-data-protection-risks).

## Artefacts

Store the plan in **Defra’s Data Vault**.

You can also save a working copy in your project’s SharePoint site for collaboration.
