## 1. Risk evaluation

**When: Before Alpha**

The Defra digital and data transformation strategy states that all IT projects and programmes must be assessed for sustainability impacts and benefits and must include sustainability in design or delivery performance indicators. This is managed through the DDTS digital sustainability assessment process.

Services should complete the [Digital Sustainability Risk Evaluation](https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/def-ddts-portfoliohub/SitePages/Sustainability.aspx) (you'll need to sign in) to identify the main risks a project will likely face.

A [Digital Sustainability Assessment](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=UCQKdycCYkyQx044U38RAo6BSY_rjTdIkAE8w1bMBStUOFE2RUFHOUQzWjhIRDAxUllJOUpSQk44SS4u) must be complete before you begin the Alpha phase, or Stage Gate 3 - Investment Decision.

## 2. Sustainability statement

**When: From Alpha onwards**

Each service should fill out and update a Digital Sustainability Statement. This allows the service to document actions taken or planned for subsequent phases against the 6 key sustainability objectives.

However, service projects may face constraints in terms of the sustainability action that they can take. This could range things like technical decisions taken or procurement that was conducted before the service delivery began, use of common capabilities and platforms, or a lack of reliable data on some environmental impacts available from suppliers.

If there are no actions appropriate for the service under one or more of the 6 strategic sustainability objectives, then this should be recorded in the Sustainability Statement.

## 3. Service assessments

**From 1 April 2026**

The 15th Service Standard point will be mandated.

Services undergoing Defra Service Assessments will receive a red, amber, or green (RAG) rating for sustainability, judged against the 15th Service Standard point.

The RAG rating should reflect the level of confidence that the assessor has that the project has taken or plans to take the actions on sustainability that is within their gift, given the constraints faced.

| Rating | Qualification |
|--------|---------------|
| Green | The service team have taken, or are planning to take, the majority of the meaningful sustainability actions possible given the context and constraints faced |
| Amber | The service team have taken, or are planning to take, a number of the meaningful sustainability actions possible given the context and constraints faced |
| Red | The service team have not taken, or are not planning to take any meaningful sustainability actions possible given the context and constraints faced |
