## 1. Risk evaluation

**When: Before Alpha**

Services should complete the Digital Sustainability Risk Evaluation. This points to the main risks a project will likely face.

## 2. Sustainability statement

**When: From Alpha onwards**

Each service should fill out and update a Digital Sustainability Statement. This allows the service to document actions taken against the 6 key objectives.

## 3. Service assessments

**From 1 April 2026**

The 15th Service Standard point will be mandated. Initially, there will be an 'advisory' RAG rating given.

This rating will reflect the assessors' level of confidence that the service has taken, or is planning to take, relevant actions.
