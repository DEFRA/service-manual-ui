While we have a clear ambition for Defra services to be tracking their carbon footprint, you don't need to be measuring the carbon footprint of your service straight away.

If data is not available, then we expect services to lay out the metrics that they would be measuring (such as carbon per user transaction).

Many meaningful sustainability actions can be taken without measurement, such as reducing data capture and storage, turning off environments when not in use, re-using components rather than developing them from scratch, and ensuring that any hardware is treated in as circular a manner as possible.
