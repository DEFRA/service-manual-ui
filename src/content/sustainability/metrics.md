We do not currently expect services to have developed a carbon metric. Many meaningful sustainability actions can be taken without measurement.

For example:

- reducing data capture and storage
- turning off environments when not in use
- reusing components rather than developing them from scratch
- ensuring hardware is treated in as circular a manner as possible
