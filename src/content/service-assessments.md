All transactional government digital services need an independent assessment. This ensures they are secure, robust, and meet user needs.

Assessors are subject matter experts who check your service against the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

## Types of assessment

- **Discovery peer review** (informal check-in)
- **Alpha** (at the end of alpha)
- **Beta** (between private and public beta)
- **Live** (between public beta and live)

## The Service Standard

All services must meet the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). It ensures services are built for user needs and are sustainable.

The Service Standard ensures public money is spent wisely. Read the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) for guidance on designing and delivering services, including [accessibility](/accessibility).

## Does my service need an assessment?

You need an assessment if your service is:

- going on GOV.UK
- requires Cabinet Office spend approval

## Service assessments in Defra

We use [Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)](http://defra.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ea-leg-project-assurance/IQDplOCbabmuR7dx6ebCfBQYARbtHN2VLLKph7dRJcuZwYQ?e=EaOYm7) (requires Defra sign-in) to ensure consistency.

## Discovery peer review

A peer review confirms if you:

- understand the problem and team priorities
- are ready for alpha

## Alpha assessment

Alpha is for testing different solutions to the problems found in discovery.

Build prototypes and test ideas. Challenge existing processes and explore new approaches.

Alphas usually last 6 to 8 weeks. **Book your assessment within 2 weeks of starting.**

## Beta and Live assessments

In beta, you build your best idea from alpha. You also prepare for the transition to live and integration with existing services.

Start with a **private beta** (limited users) to get feedback and improve.

After improving the service, you need an assessment to move to **public beta** (open to anyone).

**Book your assessment 6 weeks in advance.**

## Live phase

The live phase is for supporting and improving the service.

You will have a live assessment at the end of public beta. Spend public beta preparing for it.
