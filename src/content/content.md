Content design makes services easy to understand and use. It involves planning, writing, and managing content to meet user needs.

## Content standards

You must follow the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and use [GOV.UK design patterns](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

## Writing for Defra

When writing content for Defra services:

- use plain English
- follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)
- ensure content is accessible to everyone

## Content principles

- **Start with user needs:** Don't write content just because stakeholders want it.
- **Do less:** Only create content if there is a verified user need.
- **Design with data:** Use research and analytics to improve content.
