Content design makes services easy to understand and use. It involves planning, writing and managing content so that it meets user needs.

Defra uses content designers in all phases of delivery, from Discovery to Live. Read the [Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework definition of a content designer’s role](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/content-designer).

## Content standards

When writing content for Defra services, content designers must follow the:

- [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) - features the 12 points your service team must meet at a service assessment to prove that you’re designing a good service
- [Government Digital Service guidance on writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) - Government Digital Service guidance on how to write well for your audience, including specialists
- [GOV.UK proposition](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition) - the proposition tells you what must go on GOV.UK and what must not
- [Government Digital Service style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z) - covers style, spelling and grammar conventions for all content published on GOV.UK, arranged alphabetically
- [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) - includes styles, components and patterns that you’ll use to design a government service
- [Accessibility requirements for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) - guidance to help you and your team understand why you need to meet the website and mobile app accessibility regulations
