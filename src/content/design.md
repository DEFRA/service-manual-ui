Defra uses Service Designers and Interaction Designers to deliver services. These roles align with the Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework (DDaT):

- [Service Designer](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/service-designer)
- [Interaction Designer](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/interaction-designer)

## Standards for branding, domains, and internal services at Defra

All Defra services must meet the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and WCAG 2.2. This applies to public-facing services, internal systems, and those on domains that are not [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk).

## Inclusive design

We design for everyone. Our principles are:

- **Inclusive:** safe, easy, and dignified for everyone
- **Responsive:** based on what people say they need
- **Flexible:** usable in different ways
- **Convenient:** requiring minimal effort
- **Welcoming:** free of disabling barriers

## Accessibility

Meeting accessibility standards is about creating services that are inclusive for all users. It is covered in **point 5** of the cross-government GOV.UK Service Standard and The Technology Code of Practice. It is a legal requirement for all Defra services both internal and public facing.

Read more about:

- [Accessibility and meeting WCAG 2.2](/accessibility)
- [Managing accessibility in your project](/accessibility/manage-accessibility)
- [Testing for accessibility](/accessibility/test-for-accessibility)

The **Defra Accessibility Team** can help you understand accessibility standards and how to meet the requirements. They can also advise on how to get an external accessibility audit.

## Internal services

Internal services and case management tools must be consistent across Defra. Standardisation makes systems easier to use and training faster.

If you buy products from external suppliers, they must meet the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice).
