## Get a cloud account

You will need a specific 'Cloud Account' (separate from your standard login) if you need to:

- access the **DEV** or **TEST** environments
- perform administrative tasks on infrastructure
- deploy code to the Defra Cloud Platform

### How to apply

You can request a Cloud Account through the Service Desk. Search for ["Cloud Account Creation"](https://defragroup.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/kb_view.do%3Fsys_kb_id%3Deb55d3aefb503e105871fcdcbeefdc0f) in the Defra Group Knowledge Base (KBA) for the instructions.

## Travel securely

Taking Defra equipment or data overseas creates a security risk. You need to prepare before you travel.

### Before you travel

Check if you need approval from the Security team. You must get approval if you plan to:

- take any Defra-issued equipment (laptops, phones, tablets)
- take any sensitive physical material or documents.

### High-risk countries

You must tell the Security team if you are visiting a country where your security clearance (SC or DV) may be of concern.

You should also familiarise yourself with [Travelling securely](<https://defra.sharepoint.com/sites/Community3783/SitePages/Travel(1).aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=5fMaal&CID=35802547-1a28-4d54-a8df-485cd18fa3e2>).
