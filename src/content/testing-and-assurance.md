This section builds on the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology).

Shifting quality checks to the left of the development process (testing ideas and designs early) reduces the risks and additional costs of defects appearing later.

You can read more about our [recommended approach](/testing-and-assurance/recommended-approach) to quality assurance at Defra.

For broader guidance, see [testing your service regularly in the GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/quality-assurance-testing-your-service-regularly).

## Why test for quality

Testing for quality helps:

- provide evidence that the service does what your users need it to do
- provide evidence that the service behaves how it is expected (e.g. performance, resilience, security).

This builds customer confidence and ensures the service is fit for use.
