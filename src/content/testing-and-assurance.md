This guidance extends the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

Testing ideas and designs supports the shift left mentality and reduces the risks and additional costs of defects appearing later in development stages. More information about the rationale of testing can be found through [Quality assurance: testing your service regularly](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/quality-assurance-testing-your-service-regularly).

## Why test for quality

You will not know how good your product is until you test it in simulations of both normal and unusual conditions (for example, when your service has lots of visitors or is attacked).

Testing for quality helps you:

- make sure your service does what your users need it to do
- build your service at a cost that is acceptable to your organisation (this cost includes business change and risk, as well as money)

## Recommended approach

DDTS have a Software Development and QA policy. We adopt a risk based approach test strategy, accepting that testers and time are a finite resource. Test Assurance can be used to underpin some of that rationale. Where projects or programmes are not reaching expected standards, the risk will be heightened and remediation plans are put in place.

Following these artefacts will help your team deliver services to the quality Defra demands.
