Guidance on assuring quality and testing your digital services at Defra.

This guidance extends the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology).

Testing ideas and designs supports the 'shift left' mentality. It reduces the risks and additional costs of defects appearing later in development stages.

## Why test for quality

You will not know how good your product is until you test it in simulations of both normal and unusual conditions (for example, when your service has lots of visitors or is attacked).

Testing for quality helps you:

- make sure your service does what your users need it to do
- build your service at a cost that is acceptable to your organisation (this cost includes business change and risk, as well as money)
